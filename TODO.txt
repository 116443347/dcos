Done
----

* Create a YAML file which defines test groups
* Comment on the trade-offs of this file
* Put the linter somewhere which runs in CI
    - Collecting the tests basically means that this has to be done on a cluster
    - Let's do this as an integration test
* Create a script which can take a group name and return:
    * A pytest command?
    * A list of files?
* Create a linter which says that each test is in exactly one pattern
    - This should be roughly copied from DC/OS E2E

WIP

TODO
----

* Make a TeamCity job which consumes that script
* Make N TeamCity jobs which each consume that script
* Enable those TeamCity jobs, with triggers, and make sure that they report to GitHub
